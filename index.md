<p>
  I'm a master's student in <a href="https://unist.info/">3D Vision & Robotics Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=hNxIPzMAAAAJ&hl=ko">Prof. Kyungdon Joo</a> at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). I'm broadly interested in solving problems by Machine Learning and Neural Rendering. 
  
  Previously, I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zj-NER4AAAAJ&hl=ko">Prof.Donghyeon Cho</a> during my undergraduate studies and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SY_I6OMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Eric T. Matson</a> as a visiting student.
